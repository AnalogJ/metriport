## Overview

This is a guide to help you integrate with [Tenovi](https://tenovi.com/) - a remote patient monitoring (RPM) device provider.
When a patient takes measurements with Tenovi RPM devices, the data will be made available both through [webhooks](/home/api-info/webhooks),
and our [REST API](/devices-api/api-reference/get-biometrics-data).

<Tip>
  You can read more about what data types are supported on our [integrations
  page](/devices-api/more-info/our-integrations).
</Tip>

## Setup

<Tip>
  As a prerequisite, we recommend following our [Devices API quickstart
  guide](/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart), up to and including the "Integrate your
  app with Metriport" step.
</Tip>

To integrate with Tenovi, you will need to do the following for each of your users:

1. Obtain a [connect token](/devices-api/api-reference/user/create-connect-token) for the user;
1. Activate the user's Tenovi device(s) using the [Connect RPM Device](/devices-api/api-reference/connect/connect-rpm-device) endpoint.

<Info>
  In the Connect RPM Device endpoint, you will need to use the Tenovi `Patient ID` as the
  `deviceUserId`, and the `HWI ID`, as `deviceIds`.

## REST Endpoints

With Tenovi, you can query for past user data using one of the following endpoints:

- [getBodyData](/devices-api/api-reference/get-body-data)
- [getBiometricsData](/devices-api/api-reference/get-biometrics-data)

However, you will **need** to use the following headers (see image below for reference):

<ParamField header="x-tenovi-api-key" type="string" required>
  Your company's API key generated on Tenovi's Client Home page.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="x-tenovi-client-name" type="string" required>
  Your company's name as indicated on your custom Tenovi URL, what comes after
  "https://api2.tenovi.com/clients/...".
</ParamField>

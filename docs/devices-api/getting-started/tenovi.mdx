## Overview

This is a guide to help you integrate with Tenovi - a remote patient monitoring (RPM) hardware and software provider.
We provide an SDK that allows you to receive Tenovi data in the background via webhooks. When a patient takes measurements with Tenovi RPM devices,
Tenovi will automatically send it to the Metriport API, and we'll forward it to your webhook URL.

<Tip>
  As a prerequisite, we suggest looking at our [webhooks docs](/home/api-info/webhooks) to
  understand how the flow works.

### Connecting Tenovi

To connect to Tenovi, you will need to obtain a [connect token](/devices-api/api-reference/user/create-connect-token), and use the [Connect RPM Provider](/devices-api/api-reference/connect/connect-rpm-provider) endpoint.

---

<Info>
  Before getting started, if you are deleveloping on IOS visit the [Apple Health
  docs](/devices-api/more-info/apple-health#1-enable-healthkit) and follow the Enable HealthKit
  section to configure HealthKit.
</Info>

## Installation

```sh
npm install @metriport/react-native-sdk
npm install react-native-webview
```

You'll need to ensure that the MetriportSDK pod is installed as well.

```sh
cd ios
pod install
```

If you are using `Objective-C` for your `AppDelegate` file you will need to set it up as follows:

```objc
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "MetriportConfiguration.h" // add this line

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

   [MetriportConfiguration checkBackgroundUpdates]; // add this line

   // your code
}
```

If you are using `Swift` for your `AppDelegate` file you will need to set it up as follows:

```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit
import MetriportSDK // add this line
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
var window: UIWindow?
var bridge: RCTBridge!
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    MetriportClient.checkBackgroundUpdates() // add this line

    // your code
  }
}
```

## Usage

To use our SDK go to the root of your project and add:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { MetriportWidget } from "@metriport/react-native-sdk";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MetriportWidget
      token="CONNECT_TOKEN"
      clientApiKey="CLIENT_API_KEY"
      sandbox={false}
      style={styles.box}
    />
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
  },
});
```

<Warning>
  Ensure you use your Client Key here, and not your Secret Key. You can read more about the
  differences between the two in our [API Keys guide](/home/api-info/api-keys).
</Warning>

<Info>
  As per the guide, we recommend to store your Client Key in environment secrets, and not commit it
  in plain text to your repository.
</Info>

<Info>
  As per the Quickstart guide, you'll need to generate a token on your server before opening the
  Connect Widget. You can read more about this
  [here](/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart#4-link-to-the-metriport-connect-widget-in-your-app).

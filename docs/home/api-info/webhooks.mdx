## Overview

Usually, when an application wants to consume information from another it makes a request to
obtain such information.

Webhooks turn this around: the producer of information calls the consumer when data is available.
This way, the consumer doesn't have to poll the producer regularly to obtain information.

Metriport will call your app's webhook endpoint when user data is available - there's no way for your
application to request data exposed through webhooks.

To enable this integration approach with Metriport:

1. Expose a public endpoint on your app;
1. Set this endpoint URL on the [Developers page](https://dash.metriport.com/developers) in the developer dashboard,
   or via the [Update Settings endpoint](/home/api-reference/settings/post-settings);
1. This will generate a webhook key that should be used to authenticate requests on
   your app's endpoint (webhook).

General requirements for the endpoint:

1. Public endpoint accessible from the internet;
1. Accepts a `POST` HTTP request;
1. Verifies requests by comparing the HTTP header `x-webhook-key` with the webhook key;
1. Accepts and responds to a [`ping` message](#the-ping-message);

Additionally, depending on what Metriport APIs you're using, your endpoint will need to accept and process
different messages when they become available - specifically:

1. If using the Devices API - accept and process [user data messages](#devices-api-messages).
1. If using the Medical API - accept and process [patient data messages](#medical-api-messages).

## Authentication

Validate requests to your public endpoint by comparing the webhook key with each request's HTTP header.

The webhook key is accessible on [Developers page](https://dash.metriport.com/developers) in the developer
dashboard, or via the [Get Settings endpoint](/home/api-reference/settings/get-settings) - see how to enable webhooks on the [overview section](#overview).

The HTTP header will contain a header named `x-webhook-key` - it should contain the webhook key mentioned above.
Your app is expected to disregard requests if those don't match. We suggest returning a HTTP status code
`401` with no body in such cases.

### Generating a new webhook key

If using the dashboard: simply delete your webhook URL on the [Developers page](https://dash.metriport.com/developers), save, and enter it again.

If using the API: set the webhook URL to an empty string via the [Update Settings endpoint](/home/api-reference/settings/post-settings), and then set it
to your desired URL making another request to the same endpoint.

## Format

Webhook requests contain the relevant information on the body of the HTTP request.

There are four types of messages you can expect to receive:

- [`ping`](#the-ping-message): validation of the webhook connection between Metriport and your app;
- [user health data](#devices-api-messages): health information grouped by user (Devices API only).
- [provider connected message](#devices-api-messages): notification of a newly-connected health provider by a user (Devices API only).
- [patient data](#medical-api-messages): patient document information (Medical API only).

In general, upon successful receiving of these messages, it's expected that your app responds with a `200` HTTP
status code (OK).

There's no need to include anything on the response body.

### The `ping` message

This is a simple message to validate access to your app's webhook endpoint. Your app should
accept a `POST` request with this body...

```json
{
  "ping": "<random-sequence>"
}
```

...and respond to this request by sending back the `<random-sequence>` as below:

```json
{
  "pong": "<random-sequence>"
}
```

You can check the [webhook mock server available on our repository](https://github.com/metriport/metriport/blob/master/utils/src/mock-webhook.ts)
for a simple implementation of this message.

### Devices API messages

When using the Devices API, Metriport will send Webhook messages containing user data to your app from
connected Providers, as soon as the data becomes available.

You can see Webhook details specific to the Devices API on [this page](/devices-api/more-info/webhooks).

### Medical API messages

When using the Medical API, Metriport will send Webhook messages containing status updates to your app, as soon
as the data becomes available after initiating a document query.

You can see Webhook details specific to the Medical API on [this page](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks).

### Meta data

Webhook updates will contain meta information.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "messageId": "<message-id>",
    "when": "<date-time-in-utc>",
    "type": "devices.health-data"
  }
}
```

The format follows:

<ResponseField name="meta" type="string[]" required>
  Metadata about the message.
  <Expandable title="meta properties">

    <ResponseField name="messageId" type="string" required>
      The ID for this message from Metriport, useful for debugging purposes only;
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="when" type="string" required>
      The timestamp when this message was originally sent, formatted as [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
      (example: `2022-12-24T00:46:05.413Z`)
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="type" type="DAPIWebhookType | MAPIWebhookType" required>
      The type of the webhook message. Can be one of: `devices.provider-connected`, `devices.health-data`, `medical.document-download`, `medical.document-conversion`.
    </ResponseField>

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Retries

Sometimes, due to temporary network disruption (or whatever other reason), a Webhook payload may fail to be delivered
to your app. In these cases, Metriport will store the failed requests, and you can then manually retry them - using
either the dashboard, or the API.

<Warning>
  If you do not have the Webhook URL configured, the Metriport will not attempt to deliver Webhook
  messages for the Medical API - in which case retries are not applicable.
</Warning>

### Retry Using the Dashboard

On the [Developers page](https://dash.metriport.com/developers) in the dashboard, you're able to see the count of
Webhook requests currently processing, and a count of outstanding ones that failed:

<img className="h-100" src="/images/dash-webhook-retry.png" />

To retry failed requests, simply click the `Retry` button, and those requests will be sent to your app again.

### Retry Using the API

1. Using the [Get Webhook Status endpoint](/home/api-reference/settings/get-webhook), check to see if there are any failed requests;
1. Then, use the [Retry Webhook requests endpoint](/home/api-reference/settings/retry-webhook), to kick off the retry.

<Warning>
  Currently, the Metriport API doesn't implement automatic retries - let us know if this is
  something you need.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  There is a scenario in which a previous document query has already retrieved all of the available
  documents for a patient, in which case, the `medical.document-download` webhook notification will
  contain an empty document array: `documents: []`. Simply fetch all of the available documents with
  [this endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/get-document).

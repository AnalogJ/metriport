## Request Access

On the Metriport developer dashboard go to the [Medical API Page](https://dash.metriport.com/medical-api), to request access for use of the API.
Here you can fill out a form that will notify the Metriport team of your request.

You will need to submit:

- Contact information
- A [BAA](https://healthitsecurity.com/features/what-is-a-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-baa) in PDF format
- Give confirmation that you are authorized to make requests to the Metriport API on behalf of an entity with an [NPI number](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand) and a valid treatment purpose of use

<Warning>You will need an active subscription before submitting a request.</Warning>

Once the form is submitted a member from the Metriport team will:

- Review the information
- Sign the BAA
- Grant you access to the Medical API
- Contact you via email with the signed doc stating that your request has been approved

After approval, when you visit the "Medical API" page on the dashboard, you should then be able to access the Medical API admin functionality.

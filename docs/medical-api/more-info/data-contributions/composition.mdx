title: "Composition"
description: "A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.)."

We expect the composition to follow this pattern:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Composition",
    "status": "final",
    "type": {
      "coding": [
        {
          "code": "11506-3",
          "display": "Subsequent evaluation note",
          "system": "http://loinc.org"
        }
      ]
    },
    "date": "2024-05-16T09:00:00.000Z",
    "title": "Encounter Summary",
    "event": [{ "period": { "start": "2024-05-16T08:40:00.000Z" } }],
    "section": [
      {
        "title": "Results",
        "text": {
          "status": "generated",
          "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Results</div>"
        },
        "mode": "snapshot",
        "entry": [
          // References to any number of resources you want to include into the C-CDA document
          {
            "reference": "DiagnosticReport/<diagnosticreport-id>",
            "display": "Report 1"
          },
          {
            "reference": "Observation/<observation1-id>",
            "display": "Observation 1"
          },
          {
            "reference": "Observation/<observation2-id>",
            "display": "Observation 2"
          },
          and so on...
        ]
      }
    ],
    // These must be included
    "subject": { "reference": "Patient/<patient-id>" },
    "encounter": { "reference": "Encounter/<encounter-id>" },
    "author": [
      { "reference": "Organization/<organization-id>" },
      { "reference": "Practitioner/<practitioner-id>" }
    ]
  }
}
```

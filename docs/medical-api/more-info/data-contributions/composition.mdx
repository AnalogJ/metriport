title: "Composition"
description: "A logical assembly of FHIR resources that together constitute a logical package necessary for a document"
---

A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).

Below is a simple example of a Composition resource that's aimed to specify the **required** fields for the creation of any CDA:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Composition",
    "status": "final",
    "type": {
      "coding": [
        {
          "code": "11506-3",
          "display": "Subsequent evaluation note",
          "system": "http://loinc.org"
        }
      ]
    },
    "date": "2024-06-01T11:55:00.000Z",
    "title": "Encounter Summary",
    "event": [{ "period": { "start": "2024-06-01T11:40:00.000Z" } }],
    "section": [
      {
        "title": "Results",
        "mode": "snapshot",
        "entry": [
          {
            "reference": "Encounter/<encompassing-encounter-id>",
            "display": "Encounter 1"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "subject": { "reference": "Patient/<patient-id>" },
    "encounter": { "reference": "Encounter/<encompassing-encounter-id>" },
    "author": [
      { "reference": "Organization/<organization-id>" },
      { "reference": "Practitioner/<practitioner-id>" }
    ]
  }
}
```

This guide will teach you how to generate a Medical Record Summary, which condenses all of patients' medical records into a single document.

To do this, Metriport extracts FHIR resources across all available CDA documents for a patient and de-duplicates them, resulting in a set of unique medical records, which are then written into HTML and PDF files, making them extremely easy to navigate.

Here's the title page of an example Medical Record Summary:

## Generate using API

To generate a Medical Record Summary using Metriport API, you need to follow these steps:

1. Start a [Consolidated Data Query](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-post). This endpoint allows you to choose what [FHIR resources](/medical-api/fhir/overview) and what date range you want to include into the summary. When this query completes, a [webhook](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks) with a JSON payload containing all these resources will be sent to you.

<Tip>
  Once the query is kicked off, you can monitor its status using the [Get Consolidated Data Query
  Status](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/consolidated-data-query-get) endpoint.
</Tip>

2. Download the Medical Record Summary in a PDF or HTML format using the [Get Medical Record Summary](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/get-medical-record-summary) endpoint.

<Tip>
  Prior to creating or downloading a new Medical Record Summary, you can check when it was created,
  and whether it's available in either PDF or HTML format using the [Get Medical Record Summary
  Status](/medical-api/api-reference/fhir/get-medical-record-summary-status) endpoint.
</Tip>

## Generate using the Dashboard

To generate a Medical Record Summary from the dashboard, you need to navigate to the patient's document section as follows:

Then, select whether you want to download a new or a previously-generated (if such is available) Medical Record Summary, and click the button with the desired format to initiate the download.

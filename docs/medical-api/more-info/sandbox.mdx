Metriport offers a Sandbox environment so you can develop your medical applications more easily. This will allow you to try out
the Medical API with some development/dummy data.

After you get access to the Medical API, you can go to the Developers page and toggle the switch under the Sandbox section.

Note that youâ€™ll have to generate a separate Sandbox Secret Key.

To connect to the sandbox using the SDK just provide the `options` parameter with `sandbox = true`:

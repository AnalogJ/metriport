title: "Bulk Download URL Generation"
description: "Triggers a payload containing a list of downloadabl URLs for all the patient's documents."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/bulk-download-url"
---

When executed, this endpoint triggers an asynchronous process to generate download URLs for all the patient's documents. 

The status of the bulk download process is returned in the response. 

<Tip>
  To get updates about the bulk download process, check out our [webhooks guide](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks). Note that webhooks right now will return all available documents for a given patient.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you were to trigger this endpoint again while the process is still running, you will get a response that reflects the current progress. So essentially, only a single bulk download process will be running for a patient at any given time.

title: "Bulk Download URL"
description: "Triggers a payload containing the list of presigned URLs for all the patient's documents stored in S3."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/bulk-download-url"
---

When executed, this endpoint triggers an asynchronous process to generate presigned URLs for all the patient's documents stored in S3. 

The status of the bulk signing process is returned in the response. 

<Tip>
  To get updates about the bulk signing process, check out our [webhooks guide](/medical-api/more-info/webhooks). Note that the webhooks will only contain updates for new data fetched in the current bulk signing process.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you were to trigger this endpoint again while the process is still running, you will get a response that reflects the current progress. So essentially, only a single bulk signing process will be running for a patient at any given time.
</Warning>

api: "POST /medical/v1/document/upload"
---

This endpoint returns a presigned URL to enable you to upload your patients' medical documents with specified context to our servers, making them available to other HIEs.

## Process

To use this endpoint, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Create a prelimiary version of a Partial\<[DocumentReference](/medical-api/fhir/resources/documentreference)\> to provide context for the document. In this DocumentReference, we made it a mandatory practice to include the `type` field where you can specify the kind of document (using [LOINC](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-doc-typecodes.html), if possible),`description` field to outline a very brief description of the document, and `context` field to provide the relevant dates. Besides these mandatory fields, we ask that you try to provide as much context to the file as possible, including the practitioner (`author` field in the DocumentReference) and narrative (`text`).

<Tip>
  Note that you **do not** need to enter any references to the patient or your organization, as
  those will be inferred on our end - anything you will enter in these fields will be overwritten.
</Tip>

2. Execute the endpoint and receive a presigned URL (later reffered to as `URL`) to use for the consecutive file upload.

3. Upload the file by executing a `PUT` request using the `URL`. Provide a `Content-Length` header to indicate the size of the file content. Once the file is uploaded, the process will complete, making this document available to other HIEs.

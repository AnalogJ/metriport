title: "Start Document Query"
description: "Triggers a document query for the specified patient across HIEs."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/query"
---

When executed, this endpoint triggers an asynchronous document query with HIEs and immediately returns the status
of document query, `processing`.

When the asynchronous document query finishes, it stores new/updated document references for future requests and
updates the status of document query to `completed` - accessible through the [List Documents endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents).

<Tip>
  You can also use the [List Documents endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents) to get the current query status and
  query progress, while the query is still processing.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you were to trigger this endpoint again while the query is still processing, you will get
  a response that reflects the current query progress. So essentially, only a single document query
  will be running for a patient at a given time.
</Warning>

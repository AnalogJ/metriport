title: "Start Document Query"
description: "Triggers a document query for the specified patient across HIEs."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/query"
---

When executed, this endpoint triggers an asynchronous document query with HIEs and immediately returns the status
of document query, `processing`.

If there are documents that have yet to be stored in FHIR, we will convert them and provide the status of those conversions.

When the asynchronous document query finishes, it stores new/updated document references for future requests and
updates the status of document query to `completed` - accessible through the [List Documents endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents).

<Tip>
  You can also use the [List Documents endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents)
  to get the current query status and query progress, while the query is still processing.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you were to trigger this endpoint again while the query is still processing, you will get a
  response that reflects the current query progress. So essentially, only a single document query
  will be running for a patient at a given time.
</Warning>

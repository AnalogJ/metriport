title: "Start Document Query"
description: "Triggers a document query for the specified patient across HIEs."
api: "POST /medical/v1/document/query"
---

When executed, this endpoint triggers an asynchronous document query with HIEs and immediately returns the status
of document query, `processing`.

As the query is processing if you were to trigger this enpoint again you will receive that the query status is `processing` as well as the current progress of documents being queried.

When the asynchronous document query finishes, it stores new/updated document references for future requests and
update the status of document query to `completed` - acessible through
[List Documents endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents).

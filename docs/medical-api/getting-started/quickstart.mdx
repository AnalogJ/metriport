<Warning>
  Access to our Medical API will require you to make requests on behalf of an entity with an [NPI
  number](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand)
  for a valid
  [Treatment](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/disclosures-treatment-payment-health-care-operations/index.html)
  purpose of use.
</Warning>

## Overview

Getting started with our Medical API is pretty easy, you'll just need take the following steps:

1. [Create a developer account](#1-create-a-developer-account).
2. [Request API access](#2-request-api-access).
3. [Generate an API key](#3-generate-an-api-key).
4. [Register your Organization](#4-register-your-organization).
5. [Create Facilities and Patients](#5-create-facilities-and-patients).
6. [Get Patient Medical Documents](#6-get-patient-medical-documents). ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Let's get into it! ðŸ¤˜

## 1. Create a developer account

<Card
  title="Click me to go to the developer dashboard!"
  icon="user"
  href="https://dash.metriport.com/"
>
  This will take you to the Metriport developer dashboard where you can create your Metriport
  account, if you don't have one already.
</Card>

## 2. Request API access

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to request API access:

- In the left hand menu, click `Products & Billing`.
- Click `Get Started` on the Medical API product.
- Fill out the form, and click `Request Access` to submit the request.

Once the form is submitted, we will review your request promptly and contact you if we need any further information.

## 3. Generate an API key

After we approve your access request, take the following steps to get your API key:

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to get your API key:

- In the left hand menu, click "Products & Billing".
- Click `Get Started` on the Medical API product, and add your payment info.
- In the left hand menu, click `Developers`.
- On the Developers page, you'll be able to click the "Generate Secret Key" button.

<Info>
  This Secret Key will allow you to start making requests to the entire Metriport API on your
  behalf. Treat this like a password, and keep it somewhere safe! You can read the [API
  Keys](/home/api-info/api-keys) page to learn more about API key security best practices.
</Info>

<Tip>
  If you believe your key has been compromised, you can always revoke it and then generate a new one
  on the Developers page by clicking the trash button beside the key.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  After you get access to the Medical API, you can go to the Developers page and toggle the switch
  under the `Sandbox` section. Learn more about it [here](#sandbox-mode).

</Tip>

## 4. Register your Organization

<Info>
  For the remainder of the steps, you are able to either use the Dashboard UI, or the API - whatever
  you prefer!
</Info>

<Info>
  Pro-tip: you can use our handy [npm package](#sdk-software-development-kit) on your server
  if you're using Node:

  <Snippet file="medical-api-init.mdx" />
</Info>

First, you'll need to register an `Organization` in Metriport.

<Info>
  An `Organization` represents your company's legal corporate entity - this is needed for HIPAA
  auditing purposes so the Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) can validate who is making requests
  to the networks.
</Info>

You only need to register your `Organization` once, and you can do so by either:

### Using the API

See the [Create Organization endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization) in our API reference.

### Using the Dashboard

- In the left hand menu, click `Medical API`.
- In the Organization section, click `Create`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to register your Organization.

## 5. Create Facilities and Patients

Once your Organization is registered, you can now create `Facilities` and `Patients`. First,
you'll need to create your `Facilities`.

<Info>
  In Metriport, a `Facility` is a location that a `Patient` receives some form of treatment. You can
  create multiple `Facilities` to represent each of your care locations. Note that for telehealth
  practices, these can be virtual locations.
</Info>

You can create a `Facility` by either:

### Creating Facilities using the API

See the [Create Facility endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/facility/create-facility) in our API reference.

### Creating Facilities using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Add`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Facility.

Once you've created all of your `Facilities`, you can create the `Patients` that you treat
each facility. You can create `Patients` by either:

### Creating Patients using the API

See the [Create Patient endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/patient/create-patient) in our API reference.

### Creating Patients using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Patients` for the Facility under which to add Patients.
- In the Patients section, click `Add`.
- Fill in the details and submit the form to add your Patient.

<Info>
  When you create a Patient, Metriport automatically links the Patient to all HIE data sources
  related to the Patient based on the demographic and/or identification information provided when
  creating the Patient.
</Info>

## 6. Get Patient Medical Documents ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Now, you're able to access your Patients' medical `Documents`. This involves 2 main steps:

1. Querying for available `Documents` to get a list of metadata describing the available records.
2. Downloading the `Document` data from the URL returned in the metadata.

To query for a Patient's available `Documents`, you can either:

### Query for Documents using the API

See the [List Documents endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/list-documents) in our API reference.

### Query for Documents using the Dashboard

- On the `Medical API` page, in the Facilities section, click `Patients` for the Facility where the Patient is located.
- In the desired Patient's row, click `Documents`.
- You'll see all available Documents in the side panel.

<Info>Not all Patients will have available Documents, but they should ~95% of the time.</Info>

Once you've identified the `Document` you want to retrieve, you can download them by either:

### Downloading a Document using the API

See the [Get Document endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/get-document) in our API reference.

### Downloading a Document using the Dashboard

- In the side panel that comes up after clicking `Documents`, simply click `Download` on the desired Document.

That's it! You're now well equiped to use the Metriport API to access and manage your Patients' medical data.

As next steps, we'd recommend scoping out our [Medical API Reference](/medical-api/api-reference/organization/create-organization)
in further detail to see the other things you can do with the API.

## Additional Notes

These are additional information that might help you get the most out of our Medical API.

The base URL for the API is https://api.metriport.com

The URL for the Sandbox is https://api.sandbox.metriport.com (more about Sandbox [here](#sandbox-mode))

### SDK - Software Development Kit

We've developed a SDK to help you get access to our API without the HTTP plumbing. It's currently only available for
Node-based applications ([let us know](https://www.metriport.com/contact-us) what other languages you'd like to see it available on):

<Snippet file="medical-api-init.mdx" />

The SDK is available as a NPM package and you can access it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metriport/api).

### Sandbox Mode

Metriport offers a Sandbox environment so you can develop your medical applications more easily. This will allow you to try out
the Medical API with some dummy data.

After you get access to the Medical API, you can go to the Developers page and toggle the switch under the Sandbox section.

Note that youâ€™ll have to generate a separate Sandbox Secret Key.

To connect to the sandbox using the SDK just provide the `options` parameter with `sandbox = true`:

<Snippet file="medical-api-init-with-options.mdx" />

### Updating Data and Mid-air Collisions

To prevent updating stale data - which can lead to data loss, we recommend the usage of
[ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag).

Resources returned by Metriport's Medical API include an `eTag` property, which can later on be sent back to the API
when performing an update on said data.

The API will then compare that ETag with the one on the repository: if they don't
match it means data was updated by another process and the server will abort the update and respond with
[412 - Precondition Failed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/412); otherwise it will proceed
updating the resource.

To send the ETag to an `update` endpoint, you can use the `If-Match` HTTP header, or include an `eTag` property
on the request body. The header takes precedence if both are informed.

The SDK implements this automatically, as long as the data obtained from a `get` or `list` function is updated and sent to
the respective `update` function. Example:

```typescript
const await patient = metriportClient.getPatient("...");
// logic that updates the patient
...
// this update will automatically send the ETag if present on patient
await metriportClient.updatePatient(patient, facilityId);
```

If no ETag is provided the API will perform updates without checking for mid-air collisions. This is also called
[Optimistic Locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control#Web_usage).

Note that currently we only support ETag to prevent mid-air collisions, not for caching purposes.
